These notes are for making new CERES data figures (after January 15, 2021)

The first dataset used for these figures is gridde monthly Aqua CERES data files
located in /home/bsorenson/data/CERES/SSF_1Deg/monthly/Aqua/. These files range
from July 2002 to July 2020, containing data north of 60 degrees N. The main
variables used from these files are:

  - toa_sw_all_mon    : upwelling SW flux
  - toa_sw_clr_mon    : upwelling SW flux
  - toa_lw_all_mon    : upwelling LW flux
  - toa_lw_clr_mon    : upwelling LW flux
  - toa_wn_all_mon    : window IR TOA upwelling flux
  - toa_wn_clr_mon    : window IR TOA upwelling flux
  - toa_net_all_mon   : broadband downwelling minus reflected SW and LW upwelling 
  - toa_net_clr_mon   : broadband downwelling minus reflected SW and LW upwelling 
  - toa_alb_all_mon   : ratio of broadband SW upwelling rad and incoming TOA flux
  - toa_alb_clr_mon   : ratio of broadband SW upwelling rad and incoming TOA flux
  - toa_solar_all_mon : downwelling solar radiation

These files may be downloaded from the CERES website at:
  ceres.larc.nasa.gov/data/

The second dataset used are daily gridded Aqua CERES data files located in
/home/bsorenson/data/CERES/SSF_1Deg/daily/Aqua. The variables used in these
files are:

  - toa_sw_all_daily    : upwelling SW flux
  - toa_sw_clr_daily    : upwelling SW flux
  - toa_lw_all_daily    : upwelling LW flux
  - toa_lw_clr_daily    : upwelling LW flux
  - toa_wn_all_daily    : window IR TOA upwelling flux
  - toa_wn_clr_daily    : window IR TOA upwelling flux
  - toa_net_all_daily   : broadband downwelling minus reflected SW and LW upwelling 
  - toa_net_clr_daily   : broadband downwelling minus reflected SW and LW upwelling 
  - toa_alb_all_daily   : ratio of broadband SW upwelling rad and incoming TOA flux
  - toa_alb_clr_daily   : ratio of broadband SW upwelling rad and incoming TOA flux
  - toa_solar_all_daily : downwelling solar radiation

These files may be downloaded from the same website as above.

DATA READING AND PROCESSING

Monthly data
----------------

The first step in making the new figures is to read in the monthly data.
To do this, enter the directory (/home/bsorenson/Research/CERES/) and start up
a Python terminal using:

  $ python

Once starting the terminal, import functions from gridCERESLib.py using

  >>> from gridCERESLib import *

or

  >>> from gridCERESLib import readgridCERES

After reading in the functions, the monthly data must be read using:

  >>> CERES_data = readgridCERES(start_date,end_date,param)

where start_date and end_date are formatted as YYYYMM. 'param' is any 
one of the variables listed earlier in this file or found by printing
the data.variables.keys() after opening one of the files.

Daily data
----------------

The second step in making the new figures is to read in the daily data.
To do this, enter the directory (/home/bsorenson/Research/CERES/) and start up
a Python terminal using:

  $ python

Once starting the terminal, import functions from gridCERESLib.py using

  >>> from gridCERESLib import *

or

  >>> from gridCERESLib import readgridCERES_daily

After reading in the functions, the monthly data must be read using:

  >>> CERES_daily_data = readgridCERES_daily(start_date,end_date,param)

where start_date and end_date are formatted as YYYYMM. 'param' is any 
one of the variables listed earlier in this file or found by printing
the data.variables.keys() after opening one of the files, with the note
that the 'mon's in the previous paramter list must be changed to 'daily'.
