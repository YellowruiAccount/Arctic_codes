These notes are for making new CERES data figures (after January 15, 2021)

The first dataset used for these figures is gridde monthly Aqua CERES data files
located in /home/bsorenson/data/CERES/SSF_1Deg/monthly/Aqua/. These files range
from July 2002 to July 2020, containing data north of 60 degrees N. The main
variables used from these files are:

  - toa_sw_all_mon    : upwelling SW flux
  - toa_sw_clr_mon    : upwelling SW flux
  - toa_lw_all_mon    : upwelling LW flux
  - toa_lw_clr_mon    : upwelling LW flux
  - toa_wn_all_mon    : window IR TOA upwelling flux
  - toa_wn_clr_mon    : window IR TOA upwelling flux
  - toa_net_all_mon   : broadband downwelling minus reflected SW and LW upwelling 
  - toa_net_clr_mon   : broadband downwelling minus reflected SW and LW upwelling 
  - toa_alb_all_mon   : ratio of broadband SW upwelling rad and incoming TOA flux
  - toa_alb_clr_mon   : ratio of broadband SW upwelling rad and incoming TOA flux
  - toa_solar_all_mon : downwelling solar radiation

These files may be downloaded from the CERES website at:
  ceres.larc.nasa.gov/data/

The second dataset used are daily gridded Aqua CERES data files located in
/home/bsorenson/data/CERES/SSF_1Deg/daily/Aqua. The variables used in these
files are:

  - toa_sw_all_daily    : upwelling SW flux
  - toa_sw_clr_daily    : upwelling SW flux
  - toa_lw_all_daily    : upwelling LW flux
  - toa_lw_clr_daily    : upwelling LW flux
  - toa_wn_all_daily    : window IR TOA upwelling flux
  - toa_wn_clr_daily    : window IR TOA upwelling flux
  - toa_net_all_daily   : broadband downwelling minus reflected SW and LW upwelling 
  - toa_net_clr_daily   : broadband downwelling minus reflected SW and LW upwelling 
  - toa_alb_all_daily   : ratio of broadband SW upwelling rad and incoming TOA flux
  - toa_alb_clr_daily   : ratio of broadband SW upwelling rad and incoming TOA flux
  - toa_solar_all_daily : downwelling solar radiation

These files may be downloaded from the same website as above.

DATA READING AND PROCESSING

= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

Monthly data
----------------

The first step in making the new figures is to read in the monthly data.
To do this, enter the directory (/home/bsorenson/Research/CERES/) and start up
a Python terminal using:

  $ python

Once starting the terminal, import functions from gridCERESLib.py using

  >>> from gridCERESLib import *

or

  >>> from gridCERESLib import readgridCERES

After reading in the functions, the monthly data must be read using:

  >>> CERES_data = readgridCERES(start_date,end_date,param)

where start_date and end_date are formatted as YYYYMM. 'param' is any 
one of the variables listed earlier in this file or found by printing
the data.variables.keys() after opening one of the files.

Daily data
----------------

The second step in making the new figures is to read in the daily data.
To do this, enter the directory (/home/bsorenson/Research/CERES/) and start up
a Python terminal using:

  $ python

Once starting the terminal, import functions from gridCERESLib.py using

  >>> from gridCERESLib import *

or

  >>> from gridCERESLib import readgridCERES_daily

After reading in the functions, the monthly data must be read using:

  >>> CERES_daily_data = readgridCERES_daily(start_date,end_date,param)

where start_date and end_date are formatted as YYYYMMDD. 'param' is any 
one of the variables listed earlier in this file or found by printing
the data.variables.keys() after opening one of the files, with the note
that the 'mon's in the previous paramter list must be changed to 'daily'.

Calculating monthly climatologies
---------------------------------

After reading in the data, monthly climatologies must be calculated. These
monthly climatologies contain the average values for each of the 12 months
across all years in the file. For example, the April CERES monthly climatology
contains the gridded averages of all April monthly data between April 2002 and
April 2019. To calculate these values, use

  >>> CERES_data = calcCERES_MonthClimo(CERES_data)

plotCERES_Daily
- - - - - - - -  

To plot a single daly of gridded daly CERES data, use:

  >>> plotCERES_Daily(CERES_daily_data,day_idx)

day_idx is the index of the desired month in the dictionary. Currently,
no images are saved.

plotCERES_Month
- - - - - - - -  

To plot a single month of gridded CERES data, use:

  >>> plotCERES_Month(CERES_data,month_idx)

month_idx is the index of the desired month in the dictionary. Currently,
no images are saved.

plotCERES_MonthClimo
- - - - - - - - - -

To plot a single monthly climatology (i.e., the average April CERES data values),
use

  >>> plotCERES_MonthClimo(CERES_data,month_idx)

where month_idx is the index of the desired month (0 for January, 1 for February,
2 for March, etc.). Currently, no image is saved from this.

plotCERES_Daily_MonthAnomaly
- - - - - - - - - -

To plot single-day anomalies from the corresponding monthly climatology for
the CERES data, use 

  >>> plotCERES_Daily_MonthAnomaly(CERES_data,CERES_daily_data,day_idx)

where day_idx is the index of the desired day for which to calculate anomalies.
